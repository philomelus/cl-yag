When creating a new graphical/interactive object, these are the things you don't want to forget:

- Create a theme-mixin for all drawing related parameters
  
- Derive the object from the theme-mixin
  
- Update the theme-flat-all and theme-3d-all code, or add :after methods to update them

- Crate the following methods, to make it easy for end users to use themes:
  (defmethod (setf theme) ((theme theme-flat) (object -your-object-)))
  (defmethod (setf theme) ((theme theme-3d) (object -your-object-)))
  (defmethod (setf theme) ((theme -your-theme-mixin-) (object -your-object-)))

  They should configure their drawing parameters from the specified theme objects.
  For the 3d and flat versions, the point is to make them usable when no other
  colors have been defined.  End users can override as needed for the real world,
  but its nice to have something that just works when first starting new projects.
  For example, for a button, using the frame color from a flat theme for showing
  the button pressing.  If you used the interior color, nothing would appear and
  could be annoying/frustrating to a new user (or worse, make them think it
  doesn't work or they've done something wrong!).
